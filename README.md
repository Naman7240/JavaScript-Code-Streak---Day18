JavaScript Code of Streak - DAY18

Q) Write a JavaScript function to hide email addresses to protect from unauthorized user.

Test Data:         
console.log(protect_email("namankhandelwalvit@gmail.com"));         
"naman...@gmail.com"    

Explanation:

Here in this program, function (user_email) has been used and the mail-id given or typed by the user has been splitted in such a way so that the first 4-5 letters 
of the email-id and the last letters of the email-id after ‘@’ (where @ is included) will be visible. Rest of the id will be hidden by ..… so to protect to mail-id from unauthorized user.
